# Tour Navigation Fix

## Problem
Users could get stuck in the tutorial:
- Click "SHOW ME" → Demo runs → No way to advance
- Do action manually → No confirmation → Can't move forward
- Only options were SKIP (exits) or SHOW ME (repeats demo)

## Solution
Added **NEXT →** button to all steps.

### Button Layout Now

#### Welcome Step
```
[SKIP]  [START]
```

#### Demo Steps (Scenario, Message, Tetrad, Grid)
```
[SKIP]  [SHOW ME]  [NEXT →]
```

#### API Key Step
```
[SKIP]  [NEXT →]
```

#### Complete Step
```
[SKIP]  [DONE]
```

## User Flow Options

### Option 1: Watch Demo
1. Click **SHOW ME**
2. Watch fake cursor demonstrate
3. Click **NEXT →** when ready

### Option 2: Do It Yourself
1. Perform action manually (ignore SHOW ME)
2. Click **NEXT →** to advance

### Option 3: Skip Step
1. Click **NEXT →** without watching or doing
2. Move to next step

### Option 4: Exit Tutorial
1. Click **SKIP** anytime
2. Confirms and exits

## Changes Made

### 1. Added NEXT Button
- All demo steps now have **NEXT →** button
- API key step has **NEXT →** instead of "I DID IT"
- Secondary style (outline) to distinguish from primary action

### 2. Removed Auto-Advance
- Demo no longer auto-advances after completing
- User must click **NEXT →** to continue
- Gives time to observe result of demo
