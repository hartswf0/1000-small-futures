# Contextual Tour - Event-Driven Design

## Problem with Linear Tour

### What's Wrong
1. **Shows features before they're visible** - Explains perspective button when menu is closed
2. **No context** - Doesn't explain LEGOS or scene construction
3. **Missing key features** - Doesn't cover RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE, TETRAD INTERVENTION
4. **Wrong timing** - Shows tooltips when user can't use the feature

### Example Issues
- "Send a Message" doesn't explain LEGOS (L-E-G-O-S-U)
- "Apply Tetrad" doesn't mention perspective selector (üëÅ)
- Grid menu buttons (RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE, TETRAD INTERVENTION) never explained
- Perspective overlay affordances not covered

---

## New Approach: Contextual Tooltips

### Core Principle
**Show tooltips WHEN features become visible/available, not before.**

### Event-Driven Architecture
```
User Action ‚Üí Feature Appears ‚Üí Tooltip Shows ‚Üí User Learns
```

---

## Tooltip Triggers

### 1. First Load
**When**: Page loads, app ready
**Shows**:
- Chat Input tooltip: "Type what happens next. Use LEGOS: Location, Entity, Goal, Obstacle, Shift, Solution."

### 2. Grid Cell Click
**When**: User clicks any grid cell
**Shows**:
- Grid Menu tooltip: "Click SEND TO CHAT or RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE"

### 3. Grid Menu Opens
**When**: Grid cell menu appears
**Shows** (in sequence):
- RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE: "Analyzes emotional state, plot impact, next action, relationships"
- TETRAD INTERVENTION: "Applies McLuhan's Four Laws to this element"
- SEND TO CHAT: "Adds this entity to your message"
- SPAWN POV CHANNEL: "Creates new channel from this perspective"

### 4. Perspective Overlay Opens
**When**: User clicks RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE
**Shows**:
- Perspective Analysis tooltip: "Shows emotional state, plot impact, next action, local awareness, relational probabilities"
- GENERATE TETRAD FROM PERSPECTIVE: "Creates tetrad based on this character's viewpoint and actions"
- SEND TO CHAT: "Sends perspective analysis to chat"
- FORK POV CHANNEL: "Creates new channel exploring this perspective"

### 5. Tetrad Generated
**When**: Tetrad chips appear
**Shows**:
- Tetrad Options tooltip: "Click any chip to explore. Each applies McLuhan's Four Laws."

### 6. Perspective Selector Visible
**When**: User selects scenario with entities
**Shows**:
- üëÅ SELECT PERSPECTIVE tooltip: "Choose which entity's viewpoint for tetrad generation"

## Tooltip Content

### Chat Input
```
Title: Send a Message
Text: Type what happens next. Use LEGOS:
      ‚Ä¢ Location - Where things happen
      ‚Ä¢ Entity - Characters, objects
      ‚Ä¢ Goal - What they want
      ‚Ä¢ Obstacle - What blocks them
      ‚Ä¢ Shift - Transformations
      ‚Ä¢ Solution - Resolutions
      The AI will update the grid.
```

### Grid Cell Menu
```
Title: Grid Cell Menu
Text: This entity has multiple actions:
      ‚Ä¢ SEND TO CHAT - Add to message
      ‚Ä¢ RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE - Deep analysis
      ‚Ä¢ TETRAD INTERVENTION - McLuhan's laws
      ‚Ä¢ SPAWN POV CHANNEL - New perspective
```

### RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE
```
Title: Run Element Perspective
Text: Analyzes this entity from their viewpoint:
      ‚Ä¢ Emotional State - How they feel
      ‚Ä¢ Plot Impact - Story significance
      ‚Ä¢ Next Action - What they might do
      ‚Ä¢ Local Awareness - What they perceive
      ‚Ä¢ Relational Probabilities - Connections
```

### TETRAD INTERVENTION
```
Title: Tetrad Intervention
Text: Applies McLuhan's Four Laws:
      ‚Ä¢ Enhance - What does it amplify?
      ‚Ä¢ Reverse - What does it flip into?
      ‚Ä¢ Retrieve - What does it bring back?
      ‚Ä¢ Obsolesce - What does it replace?
```

### Perspective Overlay
```
Title: Perspective Analysis
Text: Deep character analysis showing:
      ‚Ä¢ Emotional state and motivations
      ‚Ä¢ Impact on plot and story
      ‚Ä¢ Suggested next actions
      ‚Ä¢ Awareness of surroundings
      ‚Ä¢ Relationships with other entities
      
      Use buttons below to:
      ‚Ä¢ Generate tetrad from this POV
      ‚Ä¢ Send analysis to chat
      ‚Ä¢ Fork into new channel
```

### GENERATE TETRAD FROM PERSPECTIVE
```
Title: Generate Tetrad from Perspective
Text: Creates tetrad based on this character's:
      ‚Ä¢ Current emotional state
      ‚Ä¢ Potential actions
      ‚Ä¢ Relationships
      ‚Ä¢ Story position
      
      The tetrad will show what THEY might
      enhance, reverse, retrieve, or obsolesce.
```

### üëÅ SELECT PERSPECTIVE
```
Title: Select Perspective
Text: Choose which entity's viewpoint to use
      for tetrad generation. The analysis will
      be from THEIR perspective, not neutral.
      
      Different perspectives = different tetrads.
```

## Implementation

### File Structure
```
CONTEXTUAL_TOUR.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tooltips {} - Tooltip definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shown {} - Track what's been shown
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init() - Setup triggers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setupTriggers() - Event listeners
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trigger(event) - Fire tooltips for event
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ show(key, tooltip) - Display tooltip
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dismiss(key) - Hide tooltip
```

### Tooltip Definition
```javascript
{
  trigger: 'gridMenuOpen',
  title: 'Run Element Perspective',
  text: 'Analyzes this entity...',
  target: 'button:contains("RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE")',
  position: 'left',
  highlight: true
}
```

### Triggers
- `firstLoad` - Page ready
- `gridCellClick` - User clicks grid cell
- `gridMenuOpen` - Grid menu appears
- `perspectiveOpen` - Perspective overlay appears
- `tetradGenerated` - Tetrad chips appear
- `scenarioSelected` - Scenario chosen

**Key improvements**:
1. Explains LEGOS system (L-E-G-O-S-U)
2. Covers grid menu buttons (RUN ELEMENT PERSPECTIVE, TETRAD INTERVENTION)
3. Explains perspective overlay affordances
4. Shows tooltips when features are visible
