OLOG #001: State of the Union + Ring Buffer Fix

## Summary

Complete synthetic anthropology field note documenting the current state
of the 1000 Small Futures / LEGOS Framework project. Includes critical
bug fix for ring buffer infinite recursion and updated project manifest.

## Changes

### Documentation
- Added OLOG_2025_10_23.md (comprehensive field note)
- Updated README.md (project overview, quick start, theory)
- Updated index.html (added OLOG link to footer)
- Created COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt (this file)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed ring buffer infinite recursion (thousand-ring.html)
  - Changed internal storage to _entriesArray (private)
  - Updated all 8 methods to use private array
  - Maintained backward compatibility with getter

### Status
- 14 engines operational
- Ring memory system: âœ… Fixed
- Tetrad analyzer: âœ… Operational (57 scenarios)
- Session viewer: ðŸ”„ Redesign in progress
- Belief simulator: âœ… Operational

## Ontological Claims

This commit represents more than code changesâ€”it's a field report from
the construction of anti-tools. We document not just what works, but
what it means to build computational artifacts that resist extraction.

The OLOG format (Ontology Log) treats our tools as field sites. We are
both builders and ethnographers, practicing synthetic anthropology.

## Technical Details

Ring Buffer Fix:
- Before: Compatibility getter â†’ getAll() â†’ entries getter â†’ âˆž
- After: Private _entriesArray, direct access in getAll()
- Result: No recursion, backward compatible, fully operational

Memory Management:
- Desktop: 96 entries
- Tablet: 48 entries  
- Mobile: 24 entries
- LowMemory: 12 entries
- Auto-adapts based on device memory

## Philosophy

"Software is not neutral. Every line of code is an ontological commitment.
Every interface is a theory of the user. Every data structure is a model
of time."

We are not building toolsâ€”we are building ontologies.

## Next Steps

1. Complete session viewer redesign (mobile-first)
2. Add scenario grid picker (visual, not list)
3. Implement tetrad analysis in viewer
4. Add ring memory search UI
