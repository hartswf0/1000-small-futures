# Cultural Dynamics Engine: Immediate Next Steps

## Summary of What We've Built

✅ **CULTURAL_ENGINE_RESEARCH_PLAN.md** - Theoretical framework and roadmap  
✅ **CULTURAL_ENGINE_SCENARIOS.md** - Complete scenario specifications  
✅ **CULTURAL_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Technical architecture guide

## What to Build Next: Minimal Viable Prototype

### Option 1: Static Visualization (No AI Required)
**Build first, test concepts:**

```html
thousand-cultural-static.html
```

**Features:**
- Three-layer dashboard (Pragmatic/Structural/Reflexive)
- Captain Cook scenario with 4 preset events
- Layer weight sliders
- State visualization (probability bars, coherence meters)
- Event log showing how layers respond

**Advantages:**
- No API keys needed
- Fast to build
- Validates visualization concepts
- Can test with users immediately

**Time estimate:** 4-6 hours

### Option 2: Full AI Integration
**Requires Gemini API:**

```html
thousand-cultural.html (full version)
```

**Features:**
- Everything from Option 1
- AI-driven interpretation
- User can type actions/observations
- Dynamic scenario evolution
- AI explains layer interactions

**Advantages:**
- Full interactive experience
- Open-ended exploration
- Teaches through dialogue

**Time estimate:** 12-16 hours

## Recommended Approach: Build Static First

**Week 1:** Static prototype
- Validate three-layer architecture
- Test visualization effectiveness
- Get user feedback on UI

**Week 2:** Add AI integration
- Connect to Gemini
- Implement system instructions
- Dynamic interpretation

**Week 3:** Add scenarios
- Cargo Cult
- Jesuit-Huron
- Pollution Crisis

**Week 4:** Polish and document
- Write user guide
- Create teaching materials
- Record demo video

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Three-layer simultaneous display** (not tabbed)
2. **Layer weights as primary control** (Bret Victor principle)
3. **Captain Cook as primary scenario** (best demonstrates all layers)
4. **Crisis visualization** (when layers misalign)
5. **Event-driven rather than real-time** (easier to follow)

## Files Ready for Implementation

All architectural decisions documented in:
- Research plan
- Scenario specifications
- Implementation guide

**Ready to code when you are!**

## Next Command

When ready to proceed:
1. "Build the static prototype" → I'll create thousand-cultural-static.html
2. "Build the full version" → I'll create thousand-cultural.html with AI
3. "Create teaching materials" → I'll write user guides

## The Vision (Reminder)

Transform anthropological theory from abstract text into **interactive medium** where you:
- Adjust layer weights → see how interpretation changes
- Trigger events → watch three layers respond simultaneously
- Observe crisis → understand how violence emerges from misalignment
- Switch frames → embody different theoretical positions

**This is Bayesian ethnography made tangible.**
