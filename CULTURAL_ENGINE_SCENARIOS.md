# Cultural Dynamics Engine: Scenario Definitions

## Scenario 1: Captain Cook in Hawaii (1779)

### PRAGMATIC LAYER (Obeyesekere/Windows)
**European Goals:**
- Obtain fresh provisions
- Repair damaged mast
- Secure safe harbor
- Establish trade relations

**Hawaiian Goals:**
- Maintain cosmic balance (Makahiki season)
- Preserve chiefly mana and authority
- Control resource distribution
- Manage foreign presence

**Constraints:**
- Ship damage requires extended stay
- Provisions depleting rapidly
- Makahiki season concludes
- Population density strains resources

**Utility Functions:**
```javascript
European_Utility = f(provisions, safety, repair_time, trade_value)
Hawaiian_Utility = f(cosmic_order, mana_preservation, resource_control, social_stability)
```

### STRUCTURAL LAYER (Sahlins/MacOS)
**Mythic Schema:**
- Makahiki = Season of Lono (god of fertility/peace)
- White sails = Lono's symbol
- Clockwise arrival = Mythic pattern
- Ship imagery = Cosmological correspondence

**Symbolic Mappings:**
```
P(Cook = Lono | Arrival_Pattern, Season, Ship_Appearance) = 0.85
P(Departure = Cycle_Completion | Makahiki_End) = 0.90
P(Return = Cosmological_Disruption | Wrong_Season) = 0.95
```

**Cosmological Balance:**
- Initial: 0.70 (high coherence)
- At departure: 0.85 (cycle completes)
- At return: 0.20 (symbolic crisis)

### REFLEXIVE LAYER (Geertz/Linux)
**Interpretive Frames:**

**European Frame:** "Exploration & Diplomacy"
- Hawaiians = "Noble savages" or "treacherous natives"
- Rituals = Political protocol or superstition
- Chiefs = Temporal rulers
- Gifts = Trade goods

**Hawaiian Frame:** "Divine Visitation & Cosmic Order"
- Cook = Lono (god) or chief (human)
- European rituals = Unknown supernatural practice
- Ships = Floating heiau (temples)
- Goods = Divine wealth

**Interpretive Gap:** 0.60
**Mutual Misrecognition:** 0.75

### SCENARIO PROGRESSION

**Phase 1: Initial Encounter**
```
Pragmatic: Europeans seek provisions; Hawaiians manage divine visitor
Structural: High symbolic coherence (Lono mapping active)
Reflexive: Both interpret positively through own frames
```

**Phase 2: Extended Stay**
```
Pragmatic: Resource strain increases; repair work continues
Structural: Symbolic tension builds (cycle should end)
Reflexive: Interpretive gap widens (behavior doesn't match expectations)
```

**Phase 3: Departure**
```
Pragmatic: Europeans leave; Hawaiians redistribute resources
Structural: Cosmological balance restored (cycle completes)
Reflexive: Both groups satisfied with interaction
```

**Phase 4: Return (CRISIS)**
```
Pragmatic: Mast breaks; Cook must return
Structural: SYMBOLIC INCOHERENCE (wrong season, wrong pattern)
Reflexive: Interpretive frameworks collapse

P(Cook = Lono | Return_Wrong_Season) drops to 0.15
P(Cosmological_Threat | Symbolic_Incoherence) rises to 0.90
P(Violence | Pragmatic_Frustration + Symbolic_Crisis + Interpretive_Collapse) = 0.85
```

## Scenario 2: Cargo Cult Formation

### PRAGMATIC LAYER
**Observations:**
- Planes bring unprecedented material wealth
- Soldiers perform rituals (drills, radio calls, runway maintenance)
- Cargo correlates with ritual performance
- Europeans have "secret" to cargo acquisition

**Melanesian Goals:**
- Obtain cargo (material prosperity)
- Restore pre-war balance
- Gain prestige and power
- Understand European magic

**Empirical Inference:**
```
P(Cargo_Arrives | Ritual_Performance, Runway_Ready) = observed_correlation
Action: Replicate observed rituals
Utility: Maximize P(Cargo) given available information
```

### STRUCTURAL LAYER
**Mythic Schema:**
- Cargo = Gift from ancestors
- Europeans = Interceptors of ancestral gifts
- Rituals = Communication with ancestor realm
- Planes = Ancestor vehicles

**Symbolic Encoding:**
```
P(Cargo_Is_Ancestral_Gift | Melanesian_Cosmology) = 0.90
P(Whites_Stole_Secret | Gift_Interception_Myth) = 0.80
P(Ritual_Restores_Channel | Ancestral_Communication) = 0.75
```

### REFLEXIVE LAYER
**Multiple Incompatible Frames:**

**Melanesian Frame:** "Ancestral Reciprocity"
- Cargo = Gifts meant for us
- Rituals = Proper communication protocol
- Failure = Technical error in ritual or blocked by Europeans

**Colonial Frame:** "Primitive Superstition"
- Cargo cult = Misunderstanding of modernity
- Rituals = Imitation without comprehension
- Melanesians = Backward, irrational

**Anthropological Frame:** "Rational Innovation"
- Cargo cult = Creative synthesis of new/old
- Rituals = Logical inference from observation
- Melanesians = Adapting to colonial disruption

**Key Insight:** Each frame creates different "truth". No frame is simply "correct".

## Scenario 3: Jesuit-Huron Contact (1630s)

### PRAGMATIC LAYER
**Jesuit Goals:**
- Convert Huron to Christianity (save souls)
- Establish permanent mission
- Secure French colonial alliance
- Survive in hostile environment

**Huron Goals:**
- Maintain French trade access (guns, metal)
- Form military alliance against Iroquois
- Obtain healing from disease
- Preserve social cohesion

**Crisis:** Smallpox epidemic creates desperate pragmatic stakes for both groups.

### STRUCTURAL LAYER
**Competing Cosmologies:**

**Jesuit Schema:**
- Disease = God's will or Satan's work
- Baptism = Salvation
- Huron rituals = Devil worship
- Conversion = Cosmic victory

**Huron Schema:**
- Disease = Sorcery
- Jesuits = Malevolent oki (spirits)
- Baptism = Pollution ritual
- Jesuit presence = Cosmological threat

**Symbolic Crisis:**
```
P(Jesuit = Sorcerer | Disease_Follows_Jesuits) = 0.75
P(Baptism = Death_Ritual | Baptized_Children_Die) = 0.80
P(Cosmic_Disorder | Jesuit_Presence) = 0.85
```

### REFLEXIVE LAYER
**Mutual Demonization:**
- Each interprets other through own supernatural framework
- Jesuits see Huron as demon-influenced
- Huron see Jesuits as disease-causing oki
- Disease amplifies interpretive incompatibility

**Interpretive Incommensurability:** 0.90
**Violence Potential:** 0.70

## Scenario 4: Pollution Crisis

### PRAGMATIC LAYER
**Material Consequences:**
- Illness outbreak
- Crop failure
- Social tension
- Community fragmentation

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Ritual purification (costly, uncertain)
- Exile violator (socially divisive)
- Sacrifice (extreme)
- Reinterpret taboo (challenges tradition)

### STRUCTURAL LAYER
**Cosmological Framework:**
- Sacred boundary violated
- Pollution spreads (contagious)
- Cosmic order disrupted
- Ritual restoration required

**Symbolic States:**
```
P(Cosmological_Disorder | Taboo_Violation) = 0.90
P(Pollution_Spreads | Time_Without_Purification) = increases_over_time
P(Restoration | Ritual_Performance) = function(ritual_legitimacy, belief)
```

### REFLEXIVE LAYER
**Competing Interpretive Frames:**

**Traditional Frame:** "Purity Restoration"
- Pollution is real
- Ritual is necessary
- Cosmic order must be restored

**Modernist Frame:** "Symbolic Reinterpretation"
- Taboo is outdated
- Ritual is optional
- Social adaptation required

**Skeptical Frame:** "Social Control"
- "Pollution" is manipulation
- Ritual reinforces power
- Exposure reveals arbitrary nature

**Key Dynamic:** Choice of frame determines what counts as "solution"

## Implementation Notes

### State Representation
Each scenario maintains:
```javascript
{
  pragmatic: {
    goals: Array<Goal>,
    constraints: Array<Constraint>,
    utilities: Map<Action, Float>,
    beliefs: Map<Proposition, Probability>
  },
  structural: {
    mythicSchema: Map<Symbol, SymbolicCategory>,
    coherence: Float, // 0-1
    ritualStates: Map<Ritual, Status>,
    cosmologicalBalance: Float // 0-1
  },
  reflexive: {
    frames: Array<InterpretiveFrame>,
    activeFrame: String,
    interpretiveGap: Float, // 0-1
    observerPosition: String,
    metaStability: Float // 0-1
  }
}
```

### Update Rules
1. **User Input** â†’ Interpreted by all three layers simultaneously
2. **Pragmatic Update:** Bayesian belief update based on outcomes
3. **Structural Update:** Symbolic coherence recalculation
4. **Reflexive Update:** Frame adjustment based on interpretive success
5. **Cross-Layer Feedback:** Each layer influences others

### Visualization
- **Pragmatic:** Bar charts of utilities, goal progress
- **Structural:** Coherence meter, symbolic mapping strength
- **Reflexive:** Interpretive gap visualization, competing frames

### Teaching Points
- Culture operates on multiple levels simultaneously
- Same "facts" generate different meanings in different layers
- Observation changes what is observed (reflexive layer)
- Crisis occurs when layers become misaligned
- Resolution requires restoration of multi-layer coherence
