## Usage Patterns

### For Tetrad Analysis
Each scenario can generate McLuhan's Four Laws:
1. **What does X enhance/amplify?**
2. **What does X reverse/flip into when pushed to extremes?**
3. **What does X retrieve from the past?**
4. **What does X obsolesce/make obsolete?**

### For Perspective Taking
Any scene element can be analyzed from different viewpoints:
- Grid entities (characters, objects, forces)
- Conceptual frameworks (power, time, consciousness)
- Stakeholders (those affected but not present)

### For Recursive Exploration
Each scenario includes recursive loops showing how patterns repeat and deepen:
- Technical systems (chess positions evolve, towers upgrade)
- Emotional arcs (grief cycles, doubt accumulates)
- Learning processes (fermentation batches improve, meditation deepens)
- Mythic structures (eternal recurrence, cyclic time)
