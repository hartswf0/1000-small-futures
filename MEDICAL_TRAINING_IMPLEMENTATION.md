### Example Interactions

**Upper GI Bleed:**
```
YOU: "I want to establish two large-bore IVs and start 1L normal saline wide open"
AI (as nurse): "Starting two 18-gauge IVs now. Running 1L NS wide open. Patient's 
                pressure is still 95/60. Should I hang a second liter?"
YOU: "Yes, hang another liter. Also make patient NPO and get labs: CBC, BMP, coags, 
      type and cross 4 units"
AI (as patient): "Doc, I'm still feeling really dizzy..."
```

**Migraine:**
```
YOU: "Can you tell me more about how this headache started?"
AI (as patient): "Well, I woke up this morning and it was just there, you know? 
                  Started throbbing behind my left eye. I partied a bit last night - 
                  had some wine and beers which I don't usually do."
YOU: "I'm going to do a neurologic exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?"
AI: "Patient tracks normally. EOMI, PERRLA. Cranial nerves II-XII all intact. 
     Motor 5/5 throughout. Sensory intact."
```

**Cocaine Intoxication:**
```
YOU: "I need to know exactly what you took tonight. It's important for your treatment."
AI (as patient): "Okay, okay... I had some drinks at the club, maybe 4 or 5 beers. 
                  And yeah, I snorted some coke. Just a little bit, man. But now 
                  my chest is killing me and I'm freaking out!"
YOU: "Let me examine you. I'm going to check your heart and lungs."
AI: "Patient is very agitated, sweating profusely. Pupils are dilated. Heart rate 
     very fast and regular. Lungs clear bilaterally. Patient keeps asking 'Am I 
     having a heart attack?'"
YOU: "I'm going to give you some lorazepam to help calm you down and lower your 
      blood pressure."
AI (as nurse): "Giving 2mg lorazepam IV now."
[After 10 minutes]
AI (as patient): "I'm feeling a bit better... the chest pain isn't as bad. Still 
                  scared though."
AI: "Vitals improving: HR now 100, BP 144/80."
```

**Organophosphate Poisoning:**
```
YOU: "What were you doing when the symptoms started?"
AI (as patient, confused): "I was... spraying something... bugs... in the yard. 
                             Then I started throwing up and now I can't breathe right!"
YOU: "I need to examine you. Look at me - I'm going to check your pupils."
AI: "Patient's pupils are pinpoint. He's salivating heavily, drooling. You notice 
     muscle twitching in his arms. He's wheezing audibly. Patient vomits again."
YOU: "Get me atropine 2mg IV now. Prepare for possible intubation."
AI (as nurse): "Giving atropine 2mg IV push."
[After 5 minutes]
AI (as patient): "I... I can breathe a little better now."
AI: "Vitals: HR now 60, BP 120/74. Still has fasciculations. Secretions decreased 
     slightly but still present."
YOU: "Give another 2mg atropine. Call poison control."
AI (as toxicology): "Classic organophosphate poisoning. Continue aggressive atropine 
                     until secretions dry. Consider 2-PAM for the muscle fasciculations."
```

**COPD Exacerbation:**
```
YOU: "I need to start oxygen right away. Put him on 2 liters nasal cannula."
AI (as nurse): "Starting O2 at 2L NC."
YOU: "Can you tell me about your breathing problems?"
AI (as patient, speaking slowly): "Can't... catch... my breath. Been bad... 
                                   few days. Coughing up... yellow stuff."
YOU: "Do you smoke?"
AI (as patient): "Quit... three days ago. Used to smoke... a lot."
YOU: "How long did you smoke for?"
AI (as patient): "Thirty-four years... two packs... a day."
YOU: "Let me listen to your lungs."
AI: "Diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Very poor air movement. Patient is barrel-chested. 
     You notice mild clubbing of the fingers."
YOU: "Start continuous albuterol and ipratropium nebs. Give 125mg methylprednisolone IV."
AI (as nurse): "Starting dual neb treatment now. Giving solumedrol."
[After 15 minutes]
AI (as patient): "Breathing... better now. Can talk... easier."
AI: "Vitals improving: HR 88, BP 120/80, O2 sat 95% on 2L. Wheezing significantly 
     decreased. Patient speaking in longer sentences."
